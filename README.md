# DiscordCustom
It's a simple edit of discord with bringing back the old logo and animations (hopefully)
With this everything will be very easy to edit and create your own discord logos or styles, cool uis and much, much more!
Simple releases and normal updates will mostly be posted here, like current discord versions but with the old style.
If discord mods want this taken down, I will do so.

How to use Android .apk version
Enable unknown resources in your devices settings
This will only work on android 4.4.4 and above so make sure you have a pretty decent device
install the .apk file labeled DiscordCustom from this github
And thats it!

How to use PC version
Now im not sure if this will work and all but so far we can only edit the .exe file.
So im going to create some sort of discord downloader so that you already will have all the files you will need.
Don't forget to enable developer mode in your windows 10 settings to you can install custom applications (you probally already did this.)
